        <h2 id="myheading">Async and Defer</h2>
        <p>
          There are actually two modern features we can use to bypass the
          problem of the blocking script — async and defer. Let's look at the
          difference between these two.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scripts loaded using the async attribute will download the script
          without blocking the page while the script is being fetched. However,
          once the download is complete, the script will execute, which blocks
          the page from rendering. You get no guarantee that scripts will run in
          any specific order. It is best to use async when the scripts in the
          page run independently from each other and depend on no other script
          on the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scripts loaded with the defer attribute will load in the order they
          appear on the page. They won't run until the page content has all
          loaded, which is useful if your scripts depend on the DOM being in
          place (e.g. they modify one or more elements on the page).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            ><em
              >Here is a visual representation of the different script loading
              methods and what that means for your page:</em
            ></strong
          >
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            srcset="
              ../images/async-defer-800.jpg   800w,
              ../images/async-defer-1882.jpg 1882w
            "
            sizes="(max-width:800px) 800px, 1882px"

          <!-- this is Resolution switching: The problem whereby you want to serve smaller image files to narrow-screen devices, as they don't need huge images like desktop displays do — and to serve different resolution images to high density/low density screens. You can solve this problem using vector graphics (SVG images) and the srcset with sizes attributes. -->
          <!-- Note: For the slot width, rather than providing an absolute width (for example, 480px), you can alternatively provide a width relative to the viewport (for example, 50vw) — but not a percentage. You may have noticed that the last slot width has no media condition (this is the default that is chosen when none of the media conditions are true). The browser ignores everything after the first matching condition, so be careful how you order the media conditions. -->
          <figcaption>this is the figure caption</figcaption>
          <!-- Note: From an accessibility viewpoint, captions and alt text have distinct roles. Captions benefit even people who can see the image, whereas alt text provides the same functionality as an absent image. Therefore, captions and alt text shouldn't just say the same thing, because they both appear when the image is gone. Try turning images off in your browser and see how it looks.
        A figure could be several images, a code snippet, audio, video, equations, a table, or something else.
        if an image has meaning, in terms of your content, you should use an HTML image. If an image is purely decoration, you should use CSS background images. -->

          <img src="../images/banner.png" alt="banner" />
          <!-- this is Art direction: The problem whereby you want to serve cropped images for different layouts — for example a landscape image showing a full scene for a desktop layout, and a portrait image showing the main subject zoomed in for a mobile layout. You can solve this problem using the <picture> element. -->
